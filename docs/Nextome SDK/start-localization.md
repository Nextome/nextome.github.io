# Start Localization

A full working example app is available for [iOS](https://github.com/Nextome/nextome-phoenix-iOS-whitelabel) and [android](https://github.com/Nextome/nextome-phoenix-android-whitelabel). Run the MapActivity to see Nextome Sdk in action. It also contains a seamless outdoor/indoor map integration using OpenStreetMap for outdoor and Nextome Flutter Map for indoor.

## Start localization
To start localization, call:

=== "Android"
    ```kotlin
    nextomeSdk.start()
    ```

    !!!tip "Background Mode"
        On Android, Nextome can also keep track of user indoor position while the phone screen is off or the app is in background. For more info, explore the corresponding section [here](Android/background-service.md).

=== "iOS"
    ```swift
    nextomeSdk.start()
    ```

## Stop localization
When you've done, stop the localization by calling:

=== "Android"
    ```kotlin
    nextomeSdk.stop()
    ```
=== "iOS"
    ```swift
    nextomeSdk.stop()
    ```

## Observe SDK status
It's possible to observe the current state the Nextome SDK.

You can use this data to start initializing the map or showing messages to the users and update your UI accordingly.

=== "Android"
    ```kotlin
    val state: Flow<NextomeSdkState> = nextomeSdk.getStateObservable()
    state.asLiveData().observe(this){state -> 
        
    }
    ```
=== "iOS"
    ```swift
    let observer = nextomeSdk.getStateObservable().watch {state in
    
    }
    ```

    !!!warning
        When you are no longer interested in observing the events, you must detach your listener so that your event callbacks stop getting called.
    
        ```swift
        observer.close()
        ```
         

### Nextome SDK State
`NextomeSdkState` is a simple state machine that can have different states:

  <figcaption>Nextome SDK State</figcaption>
</figure>

#### IdleState
Nextome SDK has been initialized but there is no active localization service running.

#### StartedState
Nextome has been correctly initialized and started, it's ready to scan beacons;
=== "Android"
    | Property          | Description                         |
    |:------------------|:------------------------------------|

#### SearchVenueState
Nextome is currently scanning nearby beacons to determine in which venue the user is; If the SDK is stuck here, you're probably outdoor.

=== "Android"
    | Property          | Description                         |
    |:------------------|:------------------------------------|
    | `isOutdoor: Bool` | Will always be `true` in this state |
=== "iOS"

    |:------------------|:------------------------------------|
    | `isOutdoor: Bool` | Will always be `true` in this state |

#### GetPacketState
Nextome knows the venue of the user and it's downloading from the server the associated resources (Maps, POIs, Patches...);

=== "Android"
    | Property          | Description                          |

It is possible to use `tileZipPath`, `mapHeight` and `mapWidth` to show the user a live map of the current floor.
See more on [Nextome Map integration docs](nextome-map-integration.md).

!!!note
- If the user **changes floor**, the SDK will resume from `FIND_FLOOR` state.
- If the user goes **outdoor**, the SDK will switch to `SEARCH_VENUE` state until a new indoor beacon is detected.

## Observe the user position
Nextome SDK offers an observable to listen to user position updates:

=== "Android"
    ```kotlin
    nextomeSdk.getLocalizationObservable().collect { 
       log("Localized at (${it.x}, ${it.y}), on venue ${it.venueId} on map ${it.mapId})") 
    }
    ```
=== "iOS"
    ```swift
    let observer = nextomeSdk.getLocalizationObservable().watch() {position in
                guard let position = position else {return}
                print("Got indoor position \(position.label ?? "-") (\(position.x), \(position.y), on map \(position.mapId) in venue \(position.venueId)")
    }
    ```
    !!!warning
        When you are no longer interested in observing the events, you must detach your listener so that your event callbacks stop getting called.
        ```swift
        observer.close()
        ```

## Observe errors
Nextome SDK uses different types of exceptions to report errors:

| Exception Type               | Description                                                                                                                  |
|:-----------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `GenericException`           | A generic error happened. The SDK will continue to work normally.                                                            |
| `InvalidCredentialException` | Nextome SDK was started with invalid credentials. Create a new instance of Nextome SDK with valid credentials and try again. |
| `Critical Exception`         | Nextome encountered a critical exception. It is necessary to start a new session to start localization again.                |

It is possible to observe errors using `getErrorsObservable()`:

=== "Android"
    ```kotlin

## Next steps

- Visit [Background-service](Android/background-service.md) to learn how to use the SDK even when the app is not opened in the foreground.

- Visit [Nextome map integration](nextome-map-integration.md) if you want to use our library to display the indoor map.

## Examples
A full working example app is available on [iOS](https://github.com/Nextome/nextome-phoenix-iOS-whitelabel) and [android](https://github.com/Nextome/nextome-phoenix-android-whitelabel).
Run the `MapActivity` to see Nextome Sdk in action. It also contains a seamless outdoor/indoor map integration using *OpenStreetMap* for outdoor and *Nextome Flutter Map* for indoor.
